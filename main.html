            <p>
                Dom Cobb is a skilled thief—the absolute best in the dangerous art of extraction, 
                stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state. 
                Cobb's rare ability has made him a coveted player in corporate espionage but also 
                an international fugitive. He gets a final chance at redemption by performing the 
                impossible—an inception: planting an idea into someone’s mind.
